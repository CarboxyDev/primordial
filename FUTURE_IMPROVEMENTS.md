# Primordial Soup - Future Improvements

## Basic Enhancements
- **Organism reproduction**: Allow organisms to reproduce when they have sufficient energy
- **Different organism species**: Multiple types with different behaviors, speeds, and energy requirements
- **Predator-prey dynamics**: Some organisms hunt others instead of just eating food
- **Size variation**: Organisms grow/shrink based on energy levels
- **Aging system**: Organisms have lifespans and die of old age

## Visual Improvements
- **Particle effects**: Death animations, eating effects, reproduction sparkles
- **Trails**: Leave fading trails behind moving organisms
- **Better graphics**: More detailed organism sprites or procedural shapes
- **Day/night cycle**: Background color changes over time
- **Minimap**: Show overview of the entire world

## Behavioral Intelligence
- **Pathfinding**: Organisms actively seek food instead of random movement
- **Flocking behavior**: Organisms move in groups for protection
- **Learning AI**: Basic neural networks for organism decision-making
- **Territorial behavior**: Organisms claim and defend areas
- **Memory**: Organisms remember food locations

## Environmental Features
- **Obstacles**: Rocks, walls, or barriers that organisms must navigate around
- **Water zones**: Areas that slow movement but provide hydration
- **Toxic areas**: Regions that damage organisms over time
- **Food scarcity events**: Periodic droughts that reduce food spawning
- **Temperature zones**: Hot/cold areas affecting organism behavior

## Advanced Genetics
- **DNA system**: Each organism has genes affecting traits
- **Mutation**: Random genetic changes during reproduction
- **Natural selection**: Fitter organisms are more likely to survive and reproduce
- **Trait inheritance**: Offspring inherit parent characteristics
- **Genetic diversity tracking**: Monitor population genetic health

## Performance & Polish
- **Spatial partitioning**: Optimize collision detection for large populations
- **Configurable parameters**: Sliders to adjust simulation settings in real-time
- **Save/load states**: Preserve interesting evolutionary outcomes
- **Statistics tracking**: Graphs of population over time, genetic drift
- **Export data**: Save simulation data for analysis

## Game-like Features
- **Player interaction**: Click to add food, obstacles, or influence organisms
- **Scenarios**: Pre-designed challenges or starting conditions
- **Achievement system**: Unlock milestones (population milestones, survival records)
- **Camera controls**: Zoom, pan around large worlds
- **Pause/speed controls**: Control simulation time flow

## Scientific Accuracy
- **Realistic energy metabolism**: More complex energy calculations
- **Ecological carrying capacity**: Environment supports limited population
- **Disease simulation**: Infections that spread between organisms
- **Seasonal changes**: Periodic environmental shifts
- **Migration patterns**: Organisms move to follow food sources
